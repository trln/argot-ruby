The HRS includes the \"original\" HRS and the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest-Old (AHEAD) study. These studies were merged in 1998 and now represent the United States population over age 50. The study is funded by the National Institute on Aging to provide researchers, policy analysts, and program planners with current data on the antecedents and consequences of retirement. Questionnaire topics include physical and cognitive functioning, retirement plans, family structure and transfers, demographic characteristics, housing, employment status, income, disability, health insurance, pension plans, job history, and attitudes, preferences, and expectations for the future. The survey data are linked with administrative records from the Employer Pension Study (1993 and 1999), National Death Index, Social Security Administration earnings and projected benefits data and W-2 self-employment data, and Medicare files."],"subject_geographic_tf_stored":["United States"],"note_access_restrictions_a":["AVAILABLE.
